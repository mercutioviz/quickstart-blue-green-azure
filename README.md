# Barracuda CloudGen Firewall and Web Application Firewall - Blue / Green deployment

## Introduction
Engineers have long seen the value of automating tasks. Computer science is no exception. Automation has been a goal from the early days. One limition was the infrastructure that needed to be in place for automation to take place. With virtualisation and public cloud this automation has come full circle and we can now deploy, manage, and redeploy entire infrastructures using automation techniques. We can describe the operating environment in code, validate it, test it, document it, and deploy it from a code repository. 

This is a giant change compared to the typical laborious deployment of infrastructure through CLI, web UI, client or other. 

The purpose of this demo is to showcase how you can create, configure, and secure your whole environment from code.

## Prerequisites
The tools used in this setup are HashiCorp Terraform (> 0.11.x) and RedHat Ansible (> 2.x). Both tools have their pro's and con's. Working together they help with maintaining the state of your infrastructure and they ensure the configuration is correct. The deployment can be done from either a bash shell script or from any CI tool. In our case we used Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). The Linux VSTS agent requires the Ansible and Terraform tools to be installed as well as the VSTS agent.

## Deployed resources
Following resources will be created by this deployment per color:
- One virtual network with CGF, WAF, WEB and SQL subnets
- Routing for the WEB and SQL subnets
- One CGF virtual machine with a network interface and public IP in a Availability Set
- One WAF virtual machine with a network interface and public IP in a Availability Set
- One WEB Linux virtual machine with a network interface
- One SQL Linux virtual machine with a network interface
- Two external Azure Basic Load Balancer, containing either the CGF or WAF virtual machines with a public IP and services for HTTP, HTTPS IPSEC and/or TINA VPN tunnels
- Azure Traffic Manager to switch from Blue to Green deployment and back

## Deployment

Deployment of this environment is possible via the Azure Cloud Shell. It is also possible via a system that has Terraform and Ansible installed like a docker image (jvhoof/cloudgen-essentials). However for this deployment you will need to pass the credentials for Azure via the command line or environment variables. This is done automatically in Azure Cloud Shell. 

You can also integrate the deployment of the Blue or Green environments into Azure DevOps or other CI/CD tools. 

The package provides deploy.sh and destroy.sh scripts which will build or remove the whole setup per color when the correct arguments are supplied as well as the correct environment variables are set. For Azure DevOps the YAML files are provided.

### Azure CLI

To deploy via Azure Cloud Shell you can connect via the Azure Portal or directly to [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com/). 

- Start up Azure Cloud Shell from the Azure Portal or go directly to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com/)
- Download the latest version of the Quickstart templates in the persistant clouddrive and run the deployment script:

    - blue: `cd ~/clouddrive/ && wget -qO- https://github.com/jvhoof/quickstart-blue-green-azure/archive/master.zip | jar xv && cd ~/clouddrive/quickstart-blue-green-azure-master/ && ./deploy.sh -b`
    - green: `cd ~/clouddrive/ && wget -qO- https://github.com/jvhoof/quickstart-blue-green-azure/archive/master.zip | jar xv && cd ~/clouddrive/quickstart-blue-green-azure-master/ && ./deploy.sh -g`

- Answer the questions asked by the script on the following variables: location, prefix and password.
